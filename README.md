Weeks of my life. My whack at http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

In short, displays a widget with 90-year span of weeks from selected date.
If no date is selected, display starts from current day.

## Legend: 
- Current week is marked as blue box
- "Spent" weeks are red
- "Available" weeks are green
